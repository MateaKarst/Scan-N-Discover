# Scan N Discover
This project is an interactive app that allows users to explore different regions and locations through QR codes. There are generated QR codes for various regions (Continents and Locations) and explore associated links or geographical data. The app is built using React Native and Expo for smooth cross-platform functionality.


## Features


#### Pick Your Image :
You can pick an image from your gallery.

#### ContinentFinder :
You are to select a continent within the list of displayed continents. The app will generate QR codes, one of which is correct (links to the correct Wikipedia page of the continent) and others that are intentionally incorrect, for a fun challenge.

#### LocationFinder :
The LocationFinder component allows users to input latitude and longitude coordinates. Based on the entered coordinates, the app matches them with predefined locations (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Safari) and displays the corresponding QR codes. The QR codes point to the respective websites of those locations.
